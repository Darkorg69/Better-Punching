# Better Punching
A mod, overhauling punching and breaking mechanics in a popular block game!

# Notice
* This mod is for ***Forge***!
* Both 1.16.5 and 1.18+ versions are up to date.
* I highly recommend not playing with the 1.12.2 version, as it is experimental and completely outdated.

# What does this mod do?
* This mod adds basic block bleaking mechanics.
* Basically every block, which drops you can't obtain, can't be broken.
* If you try to break it with bare-hands, you will even get punished for doing so!

## Mod features
* Most blocks now, require you to use their proper harvest tool.
* It adds basic vanilla friendly primitive tools, made from **Flint**.
* No more tree punching on day one! Punching **Wood** blocks will give you the ***Splinter*** effect.
* In order to obtain **Cactus** blocks you need to sneak first, else you will get the ***Splinter*** effect.
* Every **Glass** block will now break instantly and if broken with hands, you will get the ***Bleeding*** effect.

## Mod Effects
**Bleeding** effect is given when you punch **Glass** bare-handed.  
**Splinter** effect is given when you punch **Wood** or **Cactus** bare-handed.

## Why this mod?
I really like playing realism based modpacks, so I decided to make the game more believeble, because  
punching and breaking blocks is the main thing all players do from the beginning, to the end of the game.  
I also made this mod so it is as lightweight as possible, whilst trying to be compatible with any mod/modpack, similar mods don't achieve this.

## Important
* Every mod feature is 100% configurable in the config file.
* Mod configuration file is located in ***saves/world/server_config***!
* You can copy the config file from your world to the defaultconfig folder in order to keep your settings throughout new worlds.

## Is "x" mod compatible?
* Every mod out there ***should*** be compatible!  
* You should reference any issues found in the mod's Github repository.  
* If you happen to encounter a "bugged" block, it's most probably a fault of the mod that adds the block and I can't fix it.  
* Is there any way to exclude blocks from the mod? - No, it's impractical and bloaty, it also kills the hardcore mood this mod provides.

## Features to be implemented soon:
* Add logic for more blocks?
